# Rename-Files-To-Hash
#### Single python file to rename all files in a directory to their hash sums.

---

### Run the file
The file is written in the language `python` which means you have to have `python` installed.
If not: Do so [here](https://www.python.org/).

To run the script open a command prompt/shell and type in: `python !rename.py`
This will rename all files (itself excluded) to the hashing algorithm `md5`.

If you want to use another hashing algorithm from the list use this command:
`python rename.py [md5/sha1/sha224/sha256/sha384/sha512]`

#### Supported hashes
1. MD5
2. SHA1
3. sha224
4. sha256
5. sha384
6. sha512
